nStacker

About:
This is my first game for the TI-nSpire and it is quite simple to play!  It is very simple!  It works on the TI-nSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1.  At this time I don't know about other models.

How to put on Calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nStacker.tns file onto your calculator.  I needed ndless 3.1 installed first!

How to play:
Use either Enter/Ctrl/or space to stop the current moving line
To exit hit Esc/Home/Q to quit

Keep stacking until you reach the top.  If you lose just re-run the game.
